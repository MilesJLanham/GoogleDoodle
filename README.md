# Coffee Google Doodle
For my google doodle, I chose to theme it around older  games specifically older fighting games. Originally I wanted the google logo to twist and punch when you pressed one of the buttons but I wasn't able to figure out how to set it to return to its original position. So instead I chose for a more space invader like shooting with a fist that is triggered when you press the buttons. Overall im happy with it and learned a lot during the process.
